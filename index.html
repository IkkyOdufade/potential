                    Often times, we are led to believe that the best way to deal
                    with pain is to forget about it. Tostop thinking about it
                    and leave it in the past. We are told to remember that it
                    could have been worse and that everyone goes through one
                    thing or the other. But you know the problem with this
                    mindset? It is a bandaid on a wound that needs to be
                    treated.

                  <p>
                    When you ignore a pain without dealing with it in an
                    intentional and positive manner, you are only delaying an
                    eruption. This pain will show up in other areas of your life
                    when you least expect it. And when pain shows up in other
                    places, it affects other areas of your life. What if I told
                    you that you can make a simple decision right now that will
                    help you begin on the path to healing your pain?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What if I showed you that pain is a gift that you can use to
                    build a beautiful life for yourself? Would you believe me?
                    Would you be willing to ignore your fears and give yourself
                    a chance to live a better life? If your answer is yes, then
                    I invite you to join me on the Intentional Healing

                    I have been there, and after struggling under the weight of

                    My name is Aishah Adams and I have lived through this
                    journey that you are stuck on. I have emerged from multiple
                    traumas and gone on a journey of self-healing that helped me
                    see my pain as a gift. In a world that sees divorces as a
                    stain on the woman, I have been twice divorced. In a world
                    where 1 in 4 women will go through a miscarriage in her
                    lifetime, I have gone through 9 miscarriages. I have gone
                    through divorce and health crises, but I rose Irrespective.

                    Your pain may not be exactly like mine, but I am sure that
                    one thing that we have in common is that at some point, we
                    have let this pain rule our lives. We have lived a life of
                    unhappiness because we didn’t know how to rise above the
                    pain.
